# C# Type System

C# is a strongly typed language

Strongly typed language - restrictions imposed by a type system.

Examples:

- ✔️string helloWorld = “Hello world”;
- ❌string helloWorld = 1;

*Example 2 violates the type system restrictions because you assigned an integer to a variable declared as a string type.*

## Signed vs Unsigned Integer

#### Signed Integer Range:

sbyte: -128 to 127

#### Unsigned Integer Range:

byte: 0 to 255

## Bit Ranges

- 8-bit: up to 255
- 16-bit: up to 65,535
- 32-bit: up to 4,294,967,295
- 64-bit: up to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615

For Signed integers
Example: 8-bit’s 255 range can be defined as -128 to 127 which totals up to 255.

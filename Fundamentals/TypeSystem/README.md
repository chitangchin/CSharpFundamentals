# C# Type System

C# is a strongly typed language

Strongly typed language - restrictions imposed by a type system.

Examples:

- ✔️string helloWorld = “Hello world”;
- ❌string helloWorld = 1;

*Example 2 violates the type system restrictions because you assigned an integer to a variable declared as a string type.*
